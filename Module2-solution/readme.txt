you MAY use the simple responsive framework we developed in Lecture 24 as a starting point for this assignment.
The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px
How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23.)
Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24
Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22
Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19
